\section{Discussion}

\heng{this should not be a separate section. move it to be part of analysis subsection}
While we applied the multimodal entity representation technique to fine-grained chemical entity typing, the idea can be well generalized to other ChemIE tasks such as relation extraction and reaction event extraction, in which chemical entities play a major role. We will release new datasets on other ChemIE task in the near future.
