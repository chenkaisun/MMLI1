% Unlike news, scientific text often requires multimodal domain expertise to understand, such as molecule knowledge for chemistry text. While Natural Language Processing methods have leveraged domain knowledge to improve the quality of Information Extraction on biomedical texts with huge impact, little work has been done in core chemistry literature, which forms the foundation of many biomedical research. In this work, we give a thrust to this underexplored yet important domain by introducing CHEMET, a benchmark dataset in fine-grained entity typing, and an effective method that incorporates external multimodal knowledge. Throughout our experiments, we showed that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art models in entity typing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on tackling the problem of fine-grained chemical entity typing.

How to extract knowledge about chemical reactions from the core chemistry literature is a new emerging challenge that has not been well studied. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark data set (CHEMET) to facilitate the study of knowledge extraction in this new domain. Fine-grained chemical entity typing poses interesting new challenges especially because of the complex name mentions frequently occurring in chemistry literature and graphic representation of entities. At the same time, there are also interesting new opportunities to leverage external chemistry knowledge resources. We propose a novel multi-modal representation learning framework to solve the problem of fine-grained chemical entity typing by leveraging external resources with chemical structures and using cross-modal attention to learn effective representation of text in the chemistry domain. Experiment results show that the proposed framework outperforms multiple state-of-the-art methods.\footnote{The programs, data and resources will be made publicly available for research purpose.}
