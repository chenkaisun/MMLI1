PDGF dimers bind to PDGF receptors in the plasma membrane and induce receptor dimerisation and activation. PDGFs are involved in a wide variety of signalling processes. PDGFs are found in all vertebrates where at least 2 different chains (A and B) exist. In human (and other mammals), four types of PDGF chains (A, B, C, and D) are known which form five different dimers (AA, AB, BB, CC and DD)."}, "aspect": "cellular_component"}, "GO:0048407": {"id": "GO:0048407", "isObsolete": false, "name": "platelet-derived growth factor binding", "definition": {"text": "Interacting selectively and non-covalently with platelet-derived growth factor."}, "aspect": "molecular_function"}, "GO:0031098": {"id": "GO:0031098", "isObsolete": false, "name": "stress-activated protein kinase signaling cascade", "definition": {"text": "A series of molecular signals in which a stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) cascade relays one or more of the signals."}, "aspect": "biological_process"}, "GO:0075524": {"id": "GO:0075524", "isObsolete": false, "name": "ribosomal skipping", "definition": {"text": "A translation process in which a specific viral peptide prevents the ribosome from covalently linking a new inserted amino acid, and lets it continue translation, thereby cleaving the nascent protein while allowing translation to continue."}, "aspect": "biological_process"}, "GO:0072370": {"id": "GO:0072370", "isObsolete": false, "name": "histone H2A-S121 phosphorylation", "definition": {"text": "The modification of histone H2A by the addition of an phosphate group to a serine residue at position 121 of the histone."}, "aspect": "biological_process"}, "GO:0031827": {"id": "GO:0031827", "isObsolete": false, "name": "type 2B serotonin receptor binding", "definition": {"text": "Interacting selectively and non-covalently with a type 2B serotonin receptor."}, "aspect": "molecular_function"}, "GO:0070888": {"id": "GO:0070888", "isObsolete": false, "name": "E-box binding", "definition": {"text": "Interacting selectively and non-covalently with an E-box, a DNA motif with the consensus sequence CANNTG that is found in the promoters of a wide array of genes expressed in neurons, muscle and other tissues."}, "aspect": "molecular_function"}, "GO:0017025": {"id": "GO:0017025", "isObsolete": false, "name": "TBP-class protein binding", "definition": {"text": "Interacting selectively and non-covalently with a member of the class of TATA-binding proteins (TBP), including any of the TBP-related factors (TRFs)."}, "aspect": "molecular_function"}, "GO:0015171": {"id": "GO:0015171", "isObsolete": false, "name": "amino acid transmembrane transporter activity", "definition": {"text": "Enables the transfer of amino acids from one side of a membrane to the other.
