Inhibition of serotonin reuptake by fluoxetine enhances serotonergic function through serotonin accumulation in the synaptic space, resulting in long-term desensitization and downregulation of 5-HT receptors, preventing 5-HT-mediated signaling and leading to antidepressant, anti-anxiety, antiobsessional and antibulimic effects.

Upon administration, the highly lipophilic melphalan flufenamide penetrates cell membranes and enters cells. In aminopeptidase-positive tumor cells, melphalan flufenamide is hydrolyzed by peptidases to release the hydrophilic alkylating agent melphalan. This results in the specific release and accumulation of melphalan in aminopeptidase-positive tumor cells. Melphalan alkylates DNA at the N7 position of guanine residues and induces DNA intra- and inter-strand cross-linkages. This results in the inhibition of DNA and RNA synthesis and the induction of apoptosis, thereby inhibiting tumor cell proliferation. Peptidases are overexpressed by certain cancer cells. The administration of melphalan flufenamide allows for enhanced efficacy and reduced toxicity compared to melphalan.",

GV elicits a photodynamic action mediated by a free-radical mechanism. Furthermore, this agent dissipates the action potential on prokaryotic or eukaryotic membranes by inducing permeability, thereby leading to respiratory inhibition and subsequent cell death.",

The exact mechanism of action by which colchicines exerts its effect has not been completely established. Colchicine binds to tubulin, thereby interfering with the polymerization of tubulin, interrupting microtubule dynamics, and disrupting mitosis. This leads to an inhibition of migration of leukocytes and other inflammatory cells, thereby reducing the inflammatory response to deposited urate crystals. Colchicine may also interrupt the cycle of monosodium urate crystal deposition in joint tissues, thereby also preventing the resultant inflammatory response. Overall, colchicine decreases leukocyte chemotaxis/migration and phagocytosis to inflamed areas, and inhibits the formation and release of a chemotactic glycoprotein that is produced during phagocytosis of urate crystals.",

Blockade of ERalpha by lasofoxifene may potentially inhibit estrogen-dependent cancer cell proliferation in ER-expressing cancers. Lasofoxifene may also bind to the certain mutant forms of ERalpha, including the Y537S ESR1 mutant, making it potentially useful in the treatment of tumors that have acquired resistance to other ER-targeting agents.",

Furthermore, this agent prevents virus assembly during virus replication. Amantadine exerts its antiparkinsonian effects by stimulating the release of dopamine from striatal dopaminergic nerve terminals and inhibiting its pre-synaptic reuptake. This agent may also exert some anticholinergic effect through inhibition of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor-mediated stimulation of acetylcholine, resulting in antihyperalgesia.",

Upon administration, piperazine binds to the GABA inhibitory receptors in susceptible nematodes, thereby inducing chloride channel opening and hyperpolarization. This results in paralysis of the worm musculature and allows normal peristalsis to dislodge the worm from the intestinal lumen, which causes the worm to be expelled from the body. Unlike vertebrates where GABA is restricted to the central nervous system (CNS), the GABA receptors in helminths are also expressed in the peripheral nervous system.",

This releases the DNA-alkylating Br-IPM moiety, which introduces intra- and inter-strand DNA crosslinks in nearby cells; the crosslinks inhibit both DNA replication and cell division, and may lead to apoptosis of cells in the tumor.
